**I'm on the job market this year!**

I'm a final year PhD student at [UT Austin](http://www.utexas.edu)'s
[UToPiA](http://utopia.cs.utexas.edu) and Trishul groups, advised by [Isil
Dillig](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil) and [Swarat
Chaudhuri](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swarat). My research focuses on the
intersection of program analysis and machine learning. Specifically, I'm
interested in developing tools and techniques which can analyze machine
learning systems to guarantee safety. Before joining the UToPiA group I
received my BS in Computer Engineering and Mathematics from the [University of
Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu).
