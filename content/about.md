I am an assistant professor in the computer science department at [Reed
College](https://www.reed.edu). My research focuses on the intersection of
program analysis and machine learning, especially with an eye toward ensuring
the safety of machine learning systems. Specifically, my recent work has
explored the use of _neurosymbolic_ programming to develop agents which can
interact safely with an environment.

Prior to joining Reed, I earned my PhD at [UT Austin](http://www.utexas.edu)'s
[UToPiA](http://utopia.cs.utexas.edu) and [Trishul](https://trishul.us/)
groups, advised by [Isil Dillig](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil) and [Swarat
Chaudhuri](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swarat).
