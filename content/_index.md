# About

I'm a 2<sup>nd</sup> year PhD student at [UT Austin](http://www.utexas.edu)'s
[UToPiA](http://utopia.cs.utexas.edu) group, advised by [Isil
Dillig](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil). My research focuses on the
intersection of program analysis and machine learning. Specifically, I'm
interested in developing tools and techniques which can analyze machine
learning systems to guarantee safety. Before joining the UToPiA group I
received my BS in Computer Engineering and Mathematics from the [University of
Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu).
