My research broadly covers the intersection of programming languages and
machine learning. In particular, I am most interested in developing techniques
for proving the safety of systems with machine learning components. My early
work in this domain has focused on using abstraction refinement to prove local
robustness properties ([PLDI'19](/papers/charon-pldi-19.pdf)). More recently I
have worked on incorporating ideas from PL research to develop a framework for
deep reinforcement learning with formally guaranteed safety
([NeurIPS'20](/papers/revel-neurips2020.pdf)).

In addition, I have also done some work on using machine learning to improve
program analysis and program synthesis tools. For example, the aformentioned
PLDI paper used machine learning to figure out how to perform abstraction
refinement. Before that I worked on a system which uses machine learning to
automatically learn appropriate predicates for a predicate abstraction based
synthesis tool ([CAV'18](/papers/atlas-cav-18.pdf)).
