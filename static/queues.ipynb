Our goal is to keep track of which passengers see which agent. If more than one agent is available, passengers will choose the lowest-numbered agent. Initially, all agents are available (so, the first passenger will go to agent zero). Your goal is to complete the `simulate_tsa` function, which takes a number of agents and a list of events.
